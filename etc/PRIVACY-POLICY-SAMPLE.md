{Your App Name} uses the device’s front camera to detect your face and requires access to your device’s camera. This access can be toggled on and off at any time in your device’s settings. 

The camera images and detected face data are only used for the intended purposes. The live video feed from the front camera is never stored or sent outside your device in any form. Face data is never stored remotely, shared with third parties, or even sent to an external server. The face data only remains on your device and never leaves your device at any time. All data is stored on the device only for the duration of your current launch session. Every time you go back to home screen or close the app, the data is deleted.
